# Disc Golf Course Finder
by John Cianciolo


##### This app allows users to find a disc golf course in the greater Bay Area, California.

  - Find a local course, search by name
  - See the current weather at each course

## Getting Started
You will need a few things for this app to run:
  - Web browser (preferrably Chrome or Firefox) with Javascript enabled
  - All of the local files included here (jQuery, Knockout, styles included)

## Installation

Download the included files. The root folder should look something look like this:

```sh
$ cd disc_golf
$ ls
css/    images/   index.html    js/
$ node app
```
Open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser. You should have access to the application.
Type a course name into the search box and the course list will automatically filter. Clicking on a course name in the list (or course marker on the map) will reveal some current weather information local to that course.
